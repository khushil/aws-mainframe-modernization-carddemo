coverage_gaps:
  critical:
    - id: GAP-001
      description: No inactive accounts (all status='Y')
      recommendation: Add 5-10 accounts with ACCT-ACTIVE-STATUS = 'N'
    - id: GAP-002
      description: Missing USRSEC.txt authentication data
      recommendation: Create USRSEC.txt with admin and user records
  high:
    - id: GAP-003
      description: No declined/rejected transactions
      recommendation: Add transactions triggering rejection codes 100-109
  medium:
    - id: GAP-004
      description: No international customers (US only)
      recommendation: Add customers with non-US country codes
    - id: GAP-005
      description: No fraud test cases
      recommendation: Add suspicious transaction patterns

notes:
  - All test data files are in ASCII format
  - EBCDIC files exist but are binary equivalents
  - Transaction amounts use signed COBOL packed decimal encoding
  - Date formats: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)
  - All 78 scenarios cross-referenced to business rules
  - Boundary conditions derived from PIC clauses in copybooks
