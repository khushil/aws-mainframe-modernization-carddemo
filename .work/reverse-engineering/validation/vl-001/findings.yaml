    title: "Copybook coverage gap - 13 of 29 copybooks missing"
    description: >
      The Source File References table in DOMAIN-MODEL.md lists 14 of 29
      copybooks (48%). Missing copybooks include utility/infrastructure files
      (CODATECN, COTTL01Y, CSDAT01Y, CSMSG02Y, CSSETATY, CSSTRPFY, CSUTLDPY,
      CSUTLDWY, UNUSED1Y, CVEXPORT) and two domain-relevant files (CVCRD01Y
      for card edit working storage, CUSTREC for customer record, CVTRA07Y
      for transaction reporting).

      Downstream consumers may not discover utility copybooks that provide
      shared validation and formatting infrastructure.

      The following programs are not mentioned in any domain model document:
      CBACT02C, CBACT03C, CBACT04C, CBEXPORT, CBIMPORT, COBSWAIT, CSUTLDTC.
      CBACT01C is mentioned only in UBIQUITOUS-LANGUAGE.md as part of a range
      'CBACT01C-04C'. The batch account programs (CBACT02C-04C) handle account
      file operations that are part of the domain.

      Batch utilities for account maintenance and data import/export are
      not documented, creating gaps in modernization planning.

      Line 173 is the WS-RETURN-MSG PIC X(75) declaration. The actual INPUT-ERROR
      88-level condition is part of the WS-EDIT-STATUS group starting around line 155.
      This is a minor positional inaccuracy.

    title: "Money value object PIC mismatch"
    description: >
      DOMAIN-MODEL.md Value Objects section states Money is 'PIC S9(10)V99'
      generically. This matches account fields (ACCT-CURR-BAL etc.) but
      transaction amounts use S9(09)V99 and transaction category balances
      also use S9(09)V99. The doc correctly shows S9(09)V99 in the Transaction
      entity table but the general Value Object description says S9(10)V99.

      Several copybook line counts in the Source File References table are

      - CVACT02Y.cpy: listed as 15, actual 14

      Docs may reference '31 programs' and '30 copybooks' but actual counts
      in the repository are 29 programs (*.cbl) and 29 copybooks (*.cpy).

      is accurately characterized in the doc.

      Every PIC clause in DOMAIN-MODEL.md entity tables was verified against
      the corresponding copybook. All 50+ field definitions are exact matches
      including signed fields (S prefix), decimal positions (V99), and lengths.

      Code excerpts in BUSINESS-RULES.md for validation rules (BR-V001 through
      BR-V023), calculation rules (BR-C001 through BR-C008), and rejection rules
      (BR-R001 through BR-R005) all use correct COBOL variable names, operators,
      and literal values.
